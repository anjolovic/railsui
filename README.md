# RailsUI

RailsUI is a vision of bringing sleek, accessible, and highly customizable UI components to the Ruby on Rails ecosystem. Inspired by the aesthetics of TailwindUI and the unstyled, accessible components of Headless UI, RailsUI aims to provide a seamless user experience while maintaining the flexibility and ease-of-use that Rails developers love.

## Features

- **Sleek Design**: RailsUI embraces a clean, modern design inspired by TailwindUI, ensuring the visual appeal of your applications.
- **Accessible**: Following the principles laid down by Headless UI, RailsUI components are built with accessibility in mind, ensuring your applications are usable by everyone.
- **Customizable**: RailsUI is designed to be a starting point. Customize components to fit your brand, or use them as-is and get moving quickly.
- **Rails-centric**: Built specifically for Ruby on Rails, leveraging the power and simplicity of Rails to offer an intuitive, easy-to-use library.

## Dependencies

RailsUI is built on top of several robust and reliable gems to deliver an excellent developer experience while ensuring the library remains maintainable and extensible. Here are some of the key gems that RailsUI relies on:

- **[ViewComponent](https://github.com/github/view_component)**: For encapsulating the logic of individual UI components.
- **[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: For styling the UI components.
- **[Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/)**: For adding interactivity to the components.
- **[importmap-rails](https://github.com/rails/importmap-rails)**: For managing JavaScript libraries without a bundler.
- **[RSpec](https://rspec.info/)**: For writing tests to ensure the reliability of the components.
- **[Capybara](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara)**: For simulating user interactions and writing integration tests.
- **[SimpleCov](https://github.com/simplecov-ruby/simplecov)**: For monitoring code coverage to ensure thorough testing.
- **[RuboCop](https://rubocop.org/)**: For enforcing coding standards and promoting code quality.

These dependencies ensure that RailsUI is built on a solid foundation, allowing developers to create, customize, and extend UI components with confidence.
